# marijuana_invasion
Marijuana invasion is a python game created using pygame library, Most of the code here is from "Alien Invasion" Eric Matthes' "Python Crash Course" book, though I have added some gameplay  changes.

  * Added different levels to start the game
  * Added sound effects
    * reggae background music
    * joint crash sound
    * shooting sound
    * game over sound

## game description

In Marijauna Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. \
The player can move the ship right, left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. \
When the game begins, a fleet of marijuana leaf fills the skyand moves across and down the screen. \
The player shoots and destroys the leafs. If the player shoots all the leafs, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet.
If any leaf hits the playerâ€™s joint or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a joint. If the player loses three joints, the game ends.
